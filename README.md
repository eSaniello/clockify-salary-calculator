# clockify-salary-calculator
I use this repository to automate the extra 150% and 200% bonuses on weekends that I have to calculate manually

- Export Detailed Summary from clockify as CSV
- Rename file to data.csv
- Put the file in the same directory as app.py
- Run app.py
- Enter employee name
- Result: total salary with weekend bonus factored in
